Generalized Tic Tac Toe n*n:
A generalized Tic Tac Toe is an n*n board game where each player chooses one of the parts X or O, and 
then plays  in  an  alternate  order  to  place  his  choice  on the  board.  A  player  wins  when  they  are  able  to 
place  m  consecutive  symbols  (0s  or  Xs)  in  a contiguous  sequence  (row,  column  or  diagonal).  The  game 
may end in a draw when no one wins.
